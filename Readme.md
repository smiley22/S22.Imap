### Introduction

This repository contains an easy-to-use and well-documented .NET assembly for communicating with and
receiving electronic mail from an Internet Message Access Protocol (IMAP) server.

### Downloads

You can always get the latest package on [Nuget](http://nuget.org/packages/S22.Imap/) (includes 
.NET 4.0 and 3.5 binaries) or download the binaries (targeting .NET 4.0) as a .zip archive from 
[here](http://smiley22.github.io/Downloads/S22.Imap.zip). The
[documentation](http://smiley22.github.io/S22.Imap/Documentation/) is also available for offline
viewing as HTML or CHM and can be downloaded from 
[here](http://smiley22.github.io/Downloads/S22.Imap.Html.Documentation.zip) and 
[here](http://smiley22.github.io/Downloads/S22.Imap.Chm.Documentation.zip), respectively.

### Usage & Examples

To use the library add the S22.Imap.dll assembly to your project references in Visual Studio. Here's
a simple example that initializes a new instance of the ImapClient class and connects to Gmail's
IMAP server:

	using System;
	using S22.Imap;

	namespace Test {
		class Program {
			static void Main(string[] args) {
				// Connect on port 993 using SSL.
				using (ImapClient Client = new ImapClient("imap.gmail.com", 993, true))
				{
					Console.WriteLine("We are connected!");
				}
			}
		}
	}

[Here](https://github.com/smiley22/S22.Imap/blob/master/Examples.md) are a couple of examples of how to use
the library. Please also see the [documentation](http://smiley22.github.io/S22.Imap/Documentation/) for
further details on using the classes and methods exposed by the S22.Imap namespace.
